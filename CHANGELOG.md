# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Preserve pending group-rejoin handshakes on explicit retry. Quarantined
  coordinators retain unresolved publication debt without reserving more work.

### Security

- Verify live directory events independently at MDK's relay forwarding and
  directory ingestion boundaries before forwarding or persisting profiles,
  follow edges, relay lists, or KeyPackages (mdk#2521). Reject unsigned,
  tampered, and invalidly signed records even when a producer claims prior
  verification.
- Update the pinned Nostr SDK fork to reject tampered event content and invalid
  signatures even when the event ID is in its verification cache. This ports
  upstream nostrdevkit/nostr commits `0e08c3062186fbc6665161769037873e0a981cd5`
  and `a991ff004975deaf1ef5279969ba1c6a85f79203` (#1508).
