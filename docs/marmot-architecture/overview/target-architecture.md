# Target Architecture — Four Components

Inside the protocol package, responsibilities split into four pieces with explicit trait boundaries. Every piece above the trait is the protocol's concern; every piece below is swappable technology.

---

## The four components

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Application layer                                  │
│  (intent in, events out; no crypto or transport)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CgkaEngine                                         │
│  (coordinator + CGKA backend + capability system    │
│   + opinionated defaults over the backend)          │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐    │
│  │  TransportPeeler  (injected, pluggable)     │    │
│  │  — one impl per transport+CGKA pair         │    │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TransportAdapter                                   │
│  (moves opaque encrypted blobs over a network)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Application layer
One job: **express intent, consume events.** Sends `SendIntent` (a message, an invite, a leave). Receives a stream of `GroupEvent`s (message arrived, member added, epoch advanced). Never touches crypto, wire formats, or transports directly.

### 2. CgkaEngine
The heart. Wraps the CGKA backend (MLS/OpenMLS today, swappable), drives commit sequencing (the "coordinator"), enforces capability negotiation, and supplies opinionated defaults where the backend is unopinionated (e.g. "leave a group via SelfRemove proposal, not legacy Remove-self").

Takes `TransportMessage` in from the transport layer; produces `GroupEvent` out. Takes `SendIntent` in from the app; produces `TransportMessage` (one or more) out.

### 3. TransportPeeler
The explicit seam where a specific transport format meets a specific CGKA backend. For MLS-over-Nostr there's one peeler (`NostrMlsPeeler`); for MLS-over-FIPS-mesh there'd be a different one. Its job: wrap CGKA ciphertext with the transport envelope (outbound), unwrap the transport envelope to get CGKA ciphertext (inbound).

Two-path interface: group messages use group/epoch material; welcomes use recipient-addressed encryption. Same trait, two crypto paths.

### 4. TransportAdapter
Moves opaque blobs. Publishes `TransportMessage`s; subscribes to inbound streams. Never sees plaintext. For Nostr: wraps blobs in kind 445 / 1059 events and publishes to relays. For FIPS: wraps in mesh frames. For HTTP/P2P/BLE: whatever's appropriate.

Multiple transports can run simultaneously for the same group — the engine deduplicates by MessageId.

---

## Why the split matters

- **CGKA is the interoperability boundary.** Two clients can use different transports (one on Nostr, one on FIPS mesh) and still share a group, as long as they share the same CGKA backend. But they cannot interop across different CGKA backends — that's a different group type.
- **Transport is orthogonal to the CGKA.** Swapping transport doesn't affect group state or crypto.
- **Peeler is the explicit pair-wise seam.** Not a way to pretend transport and CGKA are independent — they're not — but an honest acknowledgment of the coupling point.
- **Storage is pluggable below the blob layer.** Blossom today for media; S3, filesystem, IPFS, self-hosted all plausible. Orthogonal to the four components above.

---

## Two-layer message model

Every message has two encryption layers, always:

```
  Outer: transport envelope (kind 445 wrap with group exporter secret, or 1059 gift-wrap for welcomes)
    ↓
  Inner: CGKA ciphertext (MLS commit, proposal, application message, or welcome)
    ↓
  Plaintext: unsigned Nostr rumor or control primitive
```

The outer is the TransportPeeler's concern; the inner is the CgkaEngine's; the plaintext is the application's.

---

## Publish-before-apply contract

Group-evolution operations (commits, adds, removes, rotations) follow a two-step flow:

1. Engine produces a `SendResult::GroupEvolution { msg, welcomes, pending }`.
2. Application publishes the commit + any welcomes via the adapter.
3. On successful publish confirmation, application calls `engine.confirm_published(pending)`.
4. Engine merges pending state and emits the corresponding `GroupEvent`.

This prevents the engine from advancing past a commit that never made it to the network.

---

## Current implementation status

The active workspace proves the shape without the old prototype tree:

- `crates/traits` defines the cross-boundary types.
- `crates/cgka-engine` implements the OpenMLS-backed engine candidate.
- `crates/cgka-session` wires the engine to encrypted account-device storage.
- `crates/storage-memory` provides in-memory storage and rollback snapshots.
- `crates/storage-sqlite` provides SQLCipher-backed persistence for Marmot
  metadata and group-scoped OpenMLS state.
- `crates/transport-nostr-peeler` maps Nostr kind `445` / `1059` events into
  engine transport messages, peels Nostr/MLS group envelopes, and handles
  NIP-59 welcomes when supplied with a local signer/decrypter.
- `crates/cgka-conformance-simulator` drives multi-client scenarios, generated
  delivery variants, and property tests over the engine.

The production perimeter is still partly outside this workspace: real transport
adapters, account key-management integration, persistence operations policy,
and packaging.
