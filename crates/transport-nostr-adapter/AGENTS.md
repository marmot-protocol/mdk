# AGENTS.md - crates/transport-nostr-adapter

Agent-facing map for the Nostr transport adapter crate.

## Scope

This crate implements the shared `TransportAdapter` boundary for Nostr-shaped traffic:

- account inbox activation,
- group subscription sync,
- stale group subscription cleanup,
- relay-event to account-scoped delivery routing,
- publish target validation and endpoint-level publish reports.

It does not own MLS peeling, CGKA convergence, storage, account key custody, or real relay socket policy by default. The
optional `sdk` feature provides `NostrSdkRelayClient` through the `NostrRelayClient` boundary and relies on `nostr-sdk`
for reconnect/backoff and relay status mechanics.

## Key files

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib.rs` | Adapter implementation, relay-client boundary, routing state, lifecycle metrics. |
| `src/key_package.rs` | Marmot kind `30443` KeyPackage event building/publishing (`NostrKeyPackagePublication`, `NostrKeyPackagePublisher`). |
| `src/relay_list.rs` | NIP-65 kind `10002` and Marmot inbox kind `10050` relay-list event building. |
| `src/sdk_client.rs` | Optional `nostr-sdk` relay client implementation and SDK planning tests. |
| `src/telemetry.rs` | Relay delivery telemetry: cross-relay arrival spread (phase 1) and subscription sync timing / initial-sync gate (phase 2); local-time, aggregate, privacy-safe. |
| `tests/inbound_routing.rs` | Public behavior tests for group delivery, welcome delivery, group sync, and publish. |

## Invariants

- Keep Nostr event DTO conversion delegated to `transport-nostr-peeler`.
- Keep `TransportDeliverySource` metadata diagnostic only; do not feed it into consensus decisions.
- Preserve account-scoped deliveries even when group subscriptions share relay endpoints.
- Keep real relay clients behind `NostrRelayClient`.
- Keep the `nostr-sdk` dependency behind the `sdk` feature.
- Keep per-relay telemetry keyed by the opaque `RelayIndex`. `resolve_relay_labels` (gated behind a
  `RelayExportConsent` token) is the only path that turns an index back into a relay URL, and exists solely for the
  opt-in export boundary. Do not add another reverse mapping or resolve indices outside that boundary.
- Do not log relay URLs, account ids, group ids, message ids, subscription ids, pubkeys, plaintext, ciphertext, or
  payload-derived values.
- Use tracing `target` plus `method` fields so crate/module/method are visible while diagnostic data stays
  aggregate-only.

## Verification

```sh
cargo test -p transport-nostr-adapter
cargo test -p transport-nostr-adapter --features sdk
```
